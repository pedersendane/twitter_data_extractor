# twitter_data_extractor
This script goes out to the public twitter api and pulls data using keywords.

You will need to have a twitter developer account and fill in the x's for:
  consumer_key = 'xxxx'
  consumer_secret = 'xxxx'
  access_key = 'xxxx'
  access_secret = 'xxxx'
  
Create a folder titled 'data' and inside 'data' create another folder titled 'data_extraction'. Leave the contents blank.
